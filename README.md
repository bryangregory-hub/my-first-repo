# Your Project's Name(Welcome to me)

This is my personal portfolio site i would be showing 3 seprate pages my portfolio website, an about me page and a projects page,
In this i would be demonstrating different techniques and methods i have learned while using HTML to make a compelling webiste with a consise layout,
whiles also providig a detail infomation about me. I would provide some of the works i have done in my time in ITE and my proceeding time in polytechnic I would also being 
providing my website and linkedin account for better refrences and they would help provide a better and detail on the little bits about me.

## Design Process
This website is for future employers and companies to refrence giving them a way to scout me out for my skills.
As a future employee, I wanted to show my skills, talent and projects to my future employers, so that they know what to expect from me if i were to work for them.
And as a potential employer, I would like to see what the person that I might pick up could provide so I could task accordingly.
I wanted to make this an ease to navigate, I try to follow a simple asthetic with contradicting prime color to give it more of a contrast against one another, I also
tried make manoviouring of the website as simple a posible by limiting the text on screen to not clutter the eye of the viewer.
When navagiting my website the user can easily identify my portfolio, more about me, projects and where to contact me.

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
Html, css was the main language used and I also used js.

## Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Side Navigation Bar / Top Navigation Bar
        i. Try to click on the "Home" confirm that it brings the user to the home section.
        ii. Try to click on the "My portfolio" confirm that it brings the user to the My portfolio section.
        iii. Try to click on the "about me" confirm that it brings the user to the about me section.
        iV. Try to click on the "projects" confirm that it brings the user to the projects section.
2. Linked Images
        i. Navitgate to the "Linkedin" section.
        ii. Try to click on the image and confirm that the image directs the user to the Linkedin page
        iii. Navitgate to the "Instgram" section.
        iv. Try to click on the image and confirm that the image directs the user to the Instgram page

Appearance:
- The website looks the same on all browsers
- The images are a bit too tight in mobile
- The images zoom in at randomly on mobile when lauch


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
